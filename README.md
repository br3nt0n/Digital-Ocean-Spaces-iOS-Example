# Digital Ocean Spaces iOS Example
This is an example project showing how to interact with [Digital Ocean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/) from an iOS app.

It relies on the official AWS S3 SDK to upload and download files from a Space, and is a Swift app.

ðŸš¨ **Note that this is purely sample code** - we don't claim to be showing best practices with this, nor should you ship this code as-is without first testing it yourself. It's meant to demonstrate _how_ you can connect to a Space using the S3 SDK, not how to build a Swift app.

This sample source code forms part of the Getting Started with Spaces course by The Cloud Hub.

## Getting started
To run this sample code:
1. Make sure you have Cocoapods installed. If not, run:
```
gem install cocoapods
```
2. Navigate to the root directory and run:
```
pod install
```
3. Open the .xcworkspace file, and then open the `SpacesFileRepository.swift` file
4. Change the `accessKey`, `secretKey` to your Spaces API key (generated (here)[https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens]), `bucket` to the name of your Space on Digital Ocean

The project should run, and you'll be able to upload and download the sample image included in the app.
