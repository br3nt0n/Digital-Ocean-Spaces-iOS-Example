# Digital Ocean Spaces iOS Example
This is an example project showing how to interact with [Digital Ocean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/) from an iOS app.

It relies on the official AWS S3 SDK to upload and download files from a Space, and is a Swift app.

Note that this is purely example code - we don't claim to be showing best practices with this, nor should you ship this code as-is without first testing it yourself.

This sample source code forms part of the Getting Started with Spaces course by The Cloud Hub.
